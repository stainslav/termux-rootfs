# MapSCII - The Whole World In Your Console.

A node.js based [Vector Tile](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Vector_tiles) to [Braille](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/braille_patterns/utf8test.htm) and [ASCII](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Standard_Code_for_Information_Interchange) renderer for [xterm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm)-compatible terminals.

## Try it out!

```sh
$ telnet mapscii.me
```

If you're on Windows, use the open source telnet client [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to connect.

## Features

* Use your mouse to drag and zoom in and out!
* Discover Point-of-Interests around any given location
* Highly customizable layer styling with [Mapbox Styles](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-style-spec/) support
* Connect to any public or private vector tile server
* Or just use the supplied and optimized [OSM2VectorTiles](https://github.com/osm2vectortiles) based one
* Work offline and discover local [VectorTile](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec)/[MBTiles](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec)
* Compatible with most Linux and OSX terminals
* Highly optimizied algorithms for a smooth experience
* 100% pure Coffee-/JavaScript! :sunglasses:

## How to install it locally

If you haven't already got Node.js >= version 4.5, then [go get it](http://nodejs.org/).

```
npm install -g mapscii
```

If you're on OSX, or get an error about file permissions, you may need to do ```sudo npm install -g mapscii```

## Running

This is pretty simple too.

```
mapscii
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

* Arrows **up**, **down**, **left**, **right** to scroll around
* Press **a** or **z** to zoom in and out
* Press **q** to quit

## Mouse control

If your terminal supports mouse events you can drag the map and use your scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

## Behind the scenes
### Libraries
#### Mastering the console
  * [`x256`](https://github.com/substack/node-x256) for converting RGB values to closest xterm-256 [color code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Xterm_256color_chart.svg)
  * [`term-mouse`](https://github.com/CoderPuppy/term-mouse) for mouse handling
  * [`keypress`](https://github.com/TooTallNate/keypress) for input handling
  * [`string-width`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/string-width) to determine visual string lengths

#### Discovering the map data
* [`vector-tile`](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-js) for [VectorTile](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1) parsing
* [`pbf`](https://github.com/mapbox/pbf) for [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) decoding
* [`mbtiles`](https://github.com/mapbox/node-mbtiles) for [MBTiles](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/blob/master/1.2/spec.md) parsing

#### Juggling the vectors and numbers
* [`earcut`](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut) for polygon triangulation
* [`rbush`](https://github.com/mourner/rbush) for 2D spatial indexing of geo and label data
* [`breseham`](https://github.com/madbence/node-bresenham) for line point calculations
* [`simplify-js`](https://github.com/mourner/simplify-js) for polyline simplifications

#### Handling the flow
* [`bluebird`](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) for all the asynchronous [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) magic
* [`node-fetch`](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) for HTTP requests
* [`userhome`](https://github.com/shama/userhome) to determine where to persist downloaded tiles

## Special thanks

* [lukasmartinelli](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli) & [manuelroth](https://github.com/manuelroth) for all their work on [OSM2VectorTiles](https://github.com/osm2vectortiles) (global vector tiles from [OSM Planet](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm))
* [mourner](https://github.com/mourner) for all his work on mindblowing GIS algorithms (like the used [earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut), [rbush](https://github.com/mourner/rbush), [simplify-js](https://github.com/mourner/simplify-js), ..)
