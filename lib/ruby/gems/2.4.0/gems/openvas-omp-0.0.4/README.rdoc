taskid=ov.task_create({"name"=>"t","comment"=>"t", "target"=>target, "config"=>config})
ov.task_start(taskid)
while not ov.task_finished(taskid) do
        stat=ov.task_get_byid(taskid)
        puts "Status: #{stat['status']}, Progress: #{stat['progress']}"
        sleep 10
end

* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
