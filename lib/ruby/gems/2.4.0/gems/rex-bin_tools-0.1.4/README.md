# Rex::BinTools

Ruby Exploitation Library (REX) for Binary Manipulation. This suite of tools
contains ElfScan, MachScan, PEScan, and BinScan.

These tools are designed to help you analyze an executable binary and search
for particular instruction sets. This is particularly useful for things like
building ROP chains or SEH exploits.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rex-bin_tools'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rex-bin_tools
