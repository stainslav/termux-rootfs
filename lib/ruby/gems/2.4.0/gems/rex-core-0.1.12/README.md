# Rex::Core

The Ruby Exploitation (rex) Core Gem. This Gem contains the odds and ends of code that so many other pieces of Rex rely upon, but that
are too small to be put into their own seperate gems. This include some of the ruby cross-platform compatibility and file utility code.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rex-core'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rex-core



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
