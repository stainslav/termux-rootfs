Searching advisories via Technet:

When you submit a query, the Technet search engine will first look it up from a product list,
and then return all the advisories that include the keyword you are looking for. If there's
no match from the product list, then the script will try a generic search. The generic method
also means you can search by MSB, KB, or even the CVE number.

Searching advisories via Google:

Searching via Google requires an API key and an Search Engine ID from Google. To obtain these,
make sure you have a Google account (such as Gmail), and then do the following:

1. Go to Google Developer's Console
    1. Enable Custom Search API
    2. Create a browser type credential. The credential is the API key.
2. Go to Custom Search
    1. Create a new search engine
    2. Under Sites to Search, set: technet.microsoft.com
    3. In your search site, get the Search Engine ID under the Basics tab.

By default, Google has a quota limit of 1000 queries per day. You can raise this limit with
a fee.

The way this tool uses Google to find advisories is the same as doing the following manually:
[Query] site:technet.microsoft.com intitle:"Microsoft Security Bulletin" -"Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary"

Dryrun mode:
Without the -d flag (destination), the tool will not download the patches, it will just find you
the download links.

Patch Extraction:
After downloading the patch, you can use the extract_msu.bat tool to automatically extract
Microsoft patches.
